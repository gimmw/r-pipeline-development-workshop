## Tidymodels

### Introduction

Overview of pipeline development and model deployment using the tidymodels framework in R. Includes a light introduction to MLOps principles for model deployment using the vetiver and plumber R packages. Demonstrates containerisation of models using Docker for deployment onto Kubernetes.

This workshop will demonstrate how one may train and deploy a TidyModels machine learning model onto Kubernetes via vetiver.

### Helpful background knowledge

Some familiarity with R. Statistical/machine learning concepts such as cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning.
